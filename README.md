## What I learned...
### Linters
I took the time to learn more about different linters used. I thought there would be one linter that is used by everyone and is "best practice".
However, after researching and watching videos on linters I realized code format and structure is subjective, to an extent of course. Thus, I decided
to create a super-linter workflow using github actions. This way when I push code to my repository I can see clearly what issues I have and where they are.
